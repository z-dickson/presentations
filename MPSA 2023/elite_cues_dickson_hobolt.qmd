# Research Questions & Motivation {auto-animate="true"}

* To what extent can elites motivate *non-compliant* behavior during the COVID-19 Pandemic? 
  + Importance of elite cues during times of crisis
  + Survey experiments vis-a-vis real world data
  + Trump & incitement on January 6th, 2021 



# Background -- what do we already know? {auto-animate="true" cite-color="#172c83"}

 * Elite cues have differential effects on adherence to social distancing in Democratic and Republican counties 
   + @grossman2020political show that US state governors' were more effective at motivating social distancing behavior in Democratic-leaning counties than Republican-leaning counties
   + @bisbee2022objective show that reductive messages from President Trump play a similar role as objective information (COVID-19 cases/deaths) in influencing social distancing behavior
 * Non-compliance behavior? 
 * How credible are partisan counterfactuals (e.g. @bisbee2022objective; @grossman_political_2020)?

## Research Design {auto-animate="true" link-color="#172c83" body-bg="white" cite-color="#172c83"}

::: {.r-fit-text}
* We leverage the fact that Trump called for the "liberation" of three specific states (MN, MI & VA) on April 17, 2020
* Data -- mobility [@facebook_mobility] & arrests [@FBI_arrests] 
* Time horizon -- state lockdowns

## Identification {auto-animate="true" link-color="#172c83" cite-color="#172c83"}
::: {.r-fit-text}
* Generalized Difference-in-Differences
  + Treatment group -- Counties in states where Trump called for liberation
  + Control group -- Counties in states where Trump did not call for liberation
  + Estimand = *targeted* cue
* Time -- State lockdowns
* Threats to identification 
  + Exclusion criteria -- protests and other state level characteristics
  + Time-varying confounders -- COVID-19 cases and deaths
* Exogeneity assumption 
  + Trump's call for liberation not likely to be a response to local conditions ([Appendix B](images/main.pdf))

# Crime {auto-animate="true" link-color="#172c83"}
::: {.r-fit-text}
 * We apply the same empirical strategy at the state level to arrests for crimes related to sentiment expressed in analysis of quote-tweets of Trump's tweets
   + NIBRS data [@FBI_arrests] on arrests for Disorderly conduct; Assault (Aggravated and Simple); Destruction/Damage/Vandalism of Property
 * We use race as a crude proxy for partisanship
   + 6% of black voters and 28% of Hispanic voters supported Trump in 2016
   + 54% of whites, including 62% of white men
 * Generalized Difference-in-Differences
   + Treatment group -- Arrests of whites in MN, MI and VA 
   + Control group -- Arrests of whites in states under local lockdowns (40 states)
   + Estimand = *targeted* cue
   + Matrix completion for inference [@athey2021matrix]

# Discussion & Concluding Remarks {auto-animate="true" cite-color="#172c83"}
::: {.r-fit-text}
 * Trump's calls for liberation led to an increase in non-compliant behavior
   + The effects were concentrated in red counties (mobility) and among whites (crime)
 * Elite cues can motivate non-compliant behavior
    + We've seen this before (i.e. Jan 6th), but identification is challenging in observational data
    + Estimates are conservative given control groups
 * Limitations & directions for future research
    + is our case (i.e. Trump/USA) unique?

# Thank you!



# Robustness {auto-animate="true"}
::: {.r-fit-text}
 * Mobility 
   + Alternative measure of mobility -- Google mobility data ([Appendix E](images/main.pdf))
     - Retail & recreation, and Aggregate mobility 
   + Alternative estimation strategy -- first-difference ([Appendix F](images/main.pdf))
 * Crime 
   + No effect of cues on arrest rate of other races ([Appendix I](images/main.pdf))
   + No effect of cues on arrest rate of entire state population ([Appendix J](images/main.pdf))
   + Alternative measurement of arrests -- Two-day moving average ([Appendix K](images/main.pdf))
   + Alternative modeling strategy -- TWFE with state & date fixed effects ([Appendix K](images/main.pdf))
