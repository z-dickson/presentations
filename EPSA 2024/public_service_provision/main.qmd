# Public Service Delivery and Populism {auto-animate="true" link-color="#172c83" body-bg="white" cite-color="#172c83" height=100}

- Do deteriorating public services cause support for right-wing populism?
  - Literature on the drivers of populism have focused primarily on economic [@margalit2019economic] and cultural explanations [@norris2019cultural]
  - Much less work on how direct experiences with poor public service provision may affect support

- So how do voters respond to deteriorating public services?
  - Do they punish the incumbent?
  - Do they shift to the populist right?
  - Are the effects conditioned by other factors, such as immigration?

# Public Service Delivery and Populism {auto-animate=true link-color="#172c83" body-bg="white" cite-color="#172c83"}


- Experiences with core public services -- such as healthcare in the UK context -- are one of the primary ways in which citizens interact with and learn about the state
- Core public service delivery is key to the social contract between representatives and voters [@besley2020state; @levi1988rule]
- Decline in the performance of public service delivery is likely to generate dissatisfaction and grievances about the establishment 
  - Validates the populist right’s anti-establishment rhetoric
- Citizens likely to punish the incumbent – but where do they go?
- Shift to the populist right
  - as a protest vote against the establishment for failure to provide core services
  - when linked with cultural arguments about competition for scarce public services with immigrants

# Expectations {auto-animate=true link-color="#172c83" body-bg="white" cite-color="#172c83" font-size="2em" font-type="serif"}

1. A decline in core local public service delivery will lead to an increase in support for the populist right among affected voters 
2. The effects of declining public services are more pronounced when such declines can be linked to an increase in immigration


# The British Context {auto-animate=true link-color="#172c83" body-bg="white" cite-color="#172c83"}


- The UK's **National Health Service** (NHS) is a universal health service, free at the point of care
- The NHS is a core public service that is highly salient to voters
- The NHS has been under increasing strain in recent years
  - Facilities closures
  - Staff shortages
  - Long waiting times

![](images/brexit_bus.png){.absolute .fragment bottom="100" right="0" align="bottom" width="350" height="250"}


- The NHS has been a key issue in recent elections/referenda
- Valence issue – vast majority of citizens favour the NHS, and higher spending on the NHS
- All parties favour the NHS in its current form (including populist right parties)

# GP Practice Closures {auto-animate=true link-color="#172c83" body-bg="white" cite-color="#172c83"}

<br>

- We focus on the closure of General Practitioner (GP) surgeries in England
- GP practices are the key access point to the NHS and other medical services
- Since 2013, nearly 1,700 practices have closed in England

## Heterogenous Treatment Effects {auto-animate=true link-color="#172c83" cite-color="#172c83" font-type="serif"}

- We estimate conditional average treatment effects (CATE) using random forests [@wager2018estimation]
- We use annual data from ONS on migration and the number of migrants registering at a GP practice for the first time

# Conclusions {auto-animate=true link-color="#172c83" cite-color="#172c83" font-type="serif"}

- Robust evidence that direct experience with deteriorating public services increases support for the populist right
- No effect on support for the main opposition party support (Labour)
- Effects are more pronounced in areas with greater inflows of immigrants
  + Competition for resources with migrants exacerbates the effect of poor public service delivery on populist right support
- **Key Takeaway:** In addition to economic and cultural factors, we should also consider how poor performance of core public services fuels populist right support
