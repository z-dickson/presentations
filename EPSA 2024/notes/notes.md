**Talk 1 - Lisa - border closures** 

how to make causal - 

- are justifications conditional on public support? for example, what's the effect of public support for a given policy on the type of justification? If there's no public opinion data available, does that change the type of justification? 

- does the type of justification matter for public support? for example, does a specific type of justification tend to increase(decrease) support for a given policy being justified. 


Talk 2: 
The missing measure of time pressure 

counterfactual - 

is 'urgency' just rhetoric? high classification accuracy 


**Talk 3:** 

Language complexity 

- social media hypothesis - does complexity differ according to space constraints (eg. parl. vs social media)

- social media is written, while parliamentary speeches are spoken 

- are politicians authoring their own posts? are aids proofreading/editing? 


**Talk 4 - Bureaucracy framing:** 

- 32 politicians in dataset 

- would we expect similar framing dynamics in different communication mediums? Perhaps looking at a different medium, such as parl. speeches

- add more data/countries; use coded tweets to train a classifier 





**Elite cues**

- when you speak about cues, are you speaking about cues about policy positions or commands/instructions more generally? 

- Coppock's persuasion in parallel -- the 'backlash' effect is controversial 

- Are you studying cues from parties or party endorsements? Vignette example
