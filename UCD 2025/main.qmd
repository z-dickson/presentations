#  Party Competition and Wedge Issue Politics

::: {.incremental}

- **Party competition** is central to understanding policy outcomes
- Parties compete on **issue ownership** [@belanger2008issue] and **entrepreneurship** [@vries2020political] 
  - Issue owners are widely recognized as **experts** on the issue
  - Entrepreneurial parties seek to **change the status quo** by politicizing new issues

# Climate Change as a Wedge Issue


*What would a wedge issue strategy look like?*

::: {.incremental}

1. **Issue attention**
   - RR parties increase salience of climate issues
2. **Adversarial positioning**
   - RR parties take an oppositional stance on climate policy
3. **Mobilizing potential**
   - A significant share of voters hold sceptical views of climate change policies 

::: 


# Expectations 

::: {.incremental}

- Increase in **salience** of climate issues for radical right parties
- RR parties will take an **adversarial position** on climate policy
- A significant share of voters who *do not already* support the RR hold **sceptical views**

## Research Design & Methods 

::: {.incremental}

- ~500k Party Press Releases from 76 parties (2010-2022)
  - Includes over 50k press releases from radical right parties
- European Social Survey data
- UK and German Election Study Panel Data
- **Text analysis** to measure salience and adversarial positioning
  - Train and validate large language models for: 
  - [Text classification](https://huggingface.co/z-dickson/CAP_multilingual)
  - [Generative summarization](https://huggingface.co/z-dickson/bart-large-cnn-climate-change-summarization)

# Discussion 

::: {.incremental}

- Climate change is a **wedge issue** that divides mainstream coalitions
- Radical right parties are increasingly **politicizing** climate change
  - Increasing salience
  - Taking adversarial positions
  - Mobilizing voters

::: 

# How Can Mainstream Parties Respond?

::: {.incremental}

- **Appeasement**
  - Germany and UK: Accommodating radical right positions on climate change
  - **Risk**: Undermining climate policy and mainstream party credibility
- **Address the Distributional Consequences of Climate Policy**
  - Socially fair climate action 
  - Failure to address the costs for lower- and middle-income groups risks backlash 
- **Communicate Climate Policy in Terms of Security and Sovereignty**
  - Reframe climate action not as sacrifice, but as a protection of national economic and social interests to counter radical right narratives
