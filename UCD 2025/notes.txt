We know from the recent IPCC report in 2023 that human-caused climate change is affecting nearly half of the world's population, with increases in extreme weather events and climate-related food-borne and water-borne diseases, each of which have resulted in increased human suffering and mortality. 

We also know that there is somewhat of a political consensus on the need for action. Barring certain extreme climate denialists on the political fringes, political elites and the public alike largely concur that action is necessary to avert the increasingly detrimental consequences of climate change. 

Yet, implementation remains contentious. With the US recently pulling out of the Paris Climate Agreement and promoting widespread fossil fuel extraction, as well as political disagreements about the how best to handle the distributional consequences of costly climate policies, it is clear that there is still much to be done to build Broader, Cross-Cutting Coalitions that support Climate Action. 

In this talk, I'll pose a straightforward puzzle: ''Despite growing consensus on the need for climate action, implementation remains politically contentious and somewhat limited. Why?'' 

Throughout the talk, I'll argue that the radical right in Europe is increasingly using climate change as a wedge issue to broaden its electoral appeal by exploiting a mainstream consensus. I'll focus on the radical right because it is key to understanding the constraints mainstream parties face when adopting bold climate policies. The radical right has been particularly successful in dividing existing coalitions and mobilizing voters on issues related to immigration and national identity and now -- I'll argue -- climate change and environmental policy as well.
