# Household Energy Costs {auto-animate="true" link-color="#172c83" body-bg="white" cite-color="#172c83" height=100}

- What's the relationship between household energy costs and support for climate change policies?
- Past work finds that when voters blame to the government for rising energy prices, they express opposition by protesting [@mcculloch2022exploration], turning against renewables [@aklin2021renewables] or even voting for populist right parties [@voeten2024energy] 
- Yet, not all price increases are due to government action
  - Global energy prices are volatile and can be driven by factors such as geopolitical events, supply chain disruptions, and weather events
  - In such cases, voters may not directly attribute blame to the government

- **Research Question:** Do rising energy costs affect support for climate change policies when prices are exogenous?

# Household Energy Costs  {auto-animate=true link-color="#172c83" body-bg="white" cite-color="#172c83"}


- Household energy costs represent a key component of the cost of living
- As energy costs consume a larger share of household income, disposable income decreases and households are more sensitive to energy price shocks
- Theories of retrospective voting suggest that voters are more likely to punish the incumbent when they perceive that the government is responsible for personal price increases [@healy2017digging; @fiorina1978economic]
- Similarly, voters may also turn against climate change policies if they perceive that these policies are responsible for rising energy prices [@aklin2021renewables; @voeten2024energy]



# Hypothesis {auto-animate=true link-color="#172c83" cite-color="#172c83" font-type="serif"}


- **Expectation:** Rising household energy costs reduce support for pro-environmental parties, climate change policies & renewable energy production

# Data {auto-animate=true link-color="#172c83" cite-color="#172c83" font-type="serif"}

::: {.r-fit-text}



- **Descriptive Data**
  + ONS data on credit defaults for energy bills [@ONS_credit_card_spending_failure]
  + Google Trends data on searches for help with energy bills [@google_trends]

- **Household Energy Costs**
  + 26 million energy efficiency certificates from the UK government between 2012-2024 [@energy_performance_data]
  + Matched with energy consumption data at the postcode level from the ONS [@ONS_energy_consumption]
  + Measured as a proportion of net household income, taken from survey data 

- **Support for Climate Change Policies**
  + British Election Study Panel data on support for climate change policies and the Green Party 
  + BEIS Public Attitudes Tracker for attitudes towards renewable energy production [@BEIS_attitudes_tracker]

# Empirical Strategy {auto-animate=true link-color="#172c83" cite-color="#172c83" font-type="serif"}
- Instrumental Variable (IV) Estimation - Wholesale next-day electricity prices from OFGEM [@ofgem_energy_data]
  + IV strategy exploits the exogeneity of global energy prices to the UK, with the UK being a price-taker in the global energy market
  + Assumptions for IV strategy: 
    - *Relevance:* Energy prices affect household energy costs (first stage F-stat > 10)
    - *Exclusion restriction:* Energy prices only affect support for climate change policies through household energy costs
- Estimation: 2SLS & TWFE regressions

- While the UK government has implemented measures to mitigate the impact of rising energy prices on households, these measures are temporary and tend to be more beneficial to wealthier households [@fetzer2023distributional]

# Preliminary Conclusions {auto-animate=true link-color="#172c83" cite-color="#172c83" font-type="serif"}

- Voters are sensitive to household energy costs, with rising energy prices leading to decreased support for climate change policies, renewable energy production and the Green Party
- Voters appear to attribute blame to the government for rising energy prices, even when these prices are exogenous
- Given that energy prices are also influenced by climate change, this could create a feedback loop where voters turn against climate change policies, leading to further price increases



# Next Steps {auto-animate=true link-color="#172c83" cite-color="#172c83" font-type="serif"}

- Alternative instruments for household energy prices (any ideas?)
- Alternative measures of support for climate change policies (voting behaviour)
- Alternative identification strategy (spatial diff-in-diff with matched control group)
