\section{Overall Summary and Strengths of the
Paper}\label{overall-summary-and-strengths-of-the-paper}

The study investigates whether the targeted allocation of government
resources, a practice known as pork barrel politics, yields electoral
rewards for incumbent parties within a multiparty system. The authors
use the 2015-2019 relocation of Danish government jobs as a case study,
analyzing its impact on the electoral performance of the incumbent
Liberal Party. Using a difference-in-differences (DiD) design, the paper
finds that the Liberal Party's vote share increased by approximately
0.43 percentage points more in the districts receiving jobs compared to
those that did not.

The paper's primary strengths lie in its methodologically rigorous
approach and its choice of a compelling case study. The DiD design,
supported by parallel pre-treatment trends, provides a strong basis for
a causal claim. The case is particularly well-suited for this analysis
because it involves a highly salient policy implemented by a
single-party minority government, which clarifies the lines of
responsibility often blurred in multiparty systems. The use of multiple
robustness checks, including varying the treatment cutpoint and applying
propensity score matching, further strengthens the credibility of the
findings.

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}

The paper's argument is compelling, but there are several areas where it
could be strengthened:

\section{1. Justification and Conceptualization of the
``Treatment''}\label{justification-and-conceptualization-of-the-treatment}

The paper defines ``treated'' districts as those within a 12-kilometer
radius of a relocated workplace. This definition is based on the
assumption that this distance creates balanced groups and corresponds to
a tax deduction threshold for transportation. However, this rationale
feels somewhat disconnected from the theoretical mechanism of pork
barrel politics, which may not be constrained by tax law definitions of
commuting.

\textbf{Potential Improvement:} While I find the empirics compelling,
the authors should strengthen the theoretical justification for this
specific distance. While the robustness check using different cutoffs is
excellent (Figure 5), the main text would benefit from a more developed
argument about the socio-economic sphere of influence. This could
involve citing data on local economic multipliers, typical housing
market effects, or a discussion of why 12 km represents a meaningful
boundary for voters to feel prioritized or perceive local economic
benefits

\section{2. The Absence of a Dose-Response
Relationship}\label{the-absence-of-a-dose-response-relationship}

The study finds that the electoral effect does not increase with the
number of jobs relocated; even small relocations yielded benefits. This
is a fascinating and counter-intuitive result that is mentioned only
briefly in the main text. The authors suggest this implies voters reward
the act of being prioritized rather than the magnitude of the economic
benefit.

\textbf{Potential Improvement:} I think that this finding is a
significant part of the paper's potential contribution and should be
given more prominence. Instead of being a secondary point, it could be
framed as a core element of the causal story. The analysis could be
moved from the appendix into the main body to explore this ``symbolic
pork'' hypothesis more deeply. This reframes the conclusion from ``pork
barrel politics works in this context'' to a more nuanced ``symbolic
gestures of distributive politics can be as effective as large-scale
ones,'' which is a more novel contribution.

\section{3. Demonstrating the Causal
Mechanism}\label{demonstrating-the-causal-mechanism}

(perhaps if extended to full paper)

The paper relies on Stein and Bickers' (1994) three conditions for pork
barrel effectiveness: awareness, attribution, and memory. It argues
these conditions are met due to the policy's salience and the clarity of
responsibility under a single-party government. While plausible, this is
an assumption.

\textbf{Potential Improvement:} The argument would be substantially
strengthened by providing direct evidence of the causal mechanism. For
instance, the authors could incorporate a qualitative or quantitative
analysis of local media coverage from 2015-2019. Did newspaper articles
in the treated districts mention the relocations and attribute them to
the Liberal Party government? This would provide empirical support that
voters were indeed made aware and that credit was assigned as
hypothesized, moving the claim from assumption to evidence-based.

\section{4. Generalizability and the ``Clarity of
Responsibility''}\label{generalizability-and-the-clarity-of-responsibility}

The paper's conclusion is that pork barrel politics can be effective in
multiparty systems. However, the authors rightly note that their case --
a single-party minority government -- is an unusual institutional
context in Denmark that enhances the clarity of responsibility. This
specific condition may be the primary driver of the effect, limiting the
generalizability of the findings to more common multiparty coalition
governments where responsibility is diffused.

\textbf{Potential Improvement:} The conclusion should more explicitly
frame the findings as being conditional on the ``clarity of
responsibility.'' The paper demonstrates a mechanism that works under
specific conditions within a multiparty system. The authors should
emphasize this limitation and suggest that future research could test
this mechanism by comparing their case to a similar distributive policy
enacted by a multiparty coalition, where the electoral reward might be
diluted or non-existent.
